## What is a Myers-Briggs Test?

The test, or the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) assessment, is a psychometric questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. By answering questions that seek to understand your preferences in certain situations, the test provides a glimpse into your personality.

## How to Shiny App Works

The Shiny App has four questions. Each question relates to one of the four personality choices. These choices are also denoted by a letter (refer to previous slide). Answering Yes will give you the 'A' type and answering No will give you the 'B' type. Once you complete the questions, a four letter term is returned to you, compiled of these letters.

Question X: 'A' or 'B'

Question 1: E or I
Question 2: S or N
Question 3: T or F
Question 4: J or P
